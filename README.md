## Signmaker v0.1

**This is a basic tool for creating simple, laser-cut signs.**

This project is a single static page that uses [RaphaelJS](http://dmitrybaranovskiy.github.io/raphael/) and jQuery to
construct SVGs from a comma-separated list.

Inspiration was drawn from the excellent laser cut case generator at http://www.makercase.com/

Pull requests welcome!
